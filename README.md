Personal Website - Maria Noelia Herne

Welcome to my personal website! This simple website is a reflection of my passion for photography and podcasting, combined with my technical skills in building web applications using Tailwind CSS, HTML, and CSS.

Technologies Used

Tailwind CSS: The website's design is powered by Tailwind CSS, enabling me to quickly style and customize components for a polished look.

Showcase of My Work

Photography: My portfolio showcases captivating moments captured through the lens, evoking emotions and stories through each image.

Podcasting: Explore my podcasting section, where I share engaging content and conversations with fascinating guests on diverse topics.

Future Iterations:

I plan on adding more dynamic elements using React, such as a navigation bar that scrolls to sections of the website. I also will make the website mobile-friendly with features such as a carousel for the photos in the portfolio.
