            <div class='mt-5 ml-10'>
              <p> Last summer, I had the amazing opportunity to cohost the Techsetters summer season! I interviewed 10 leaders and entrepreneurs, highlighting
                their journey as women navigating the tech space.</p>
              <h1 className='text-left font-bold mt-2'> What is Techsetters?</h1>
              <p>The vision of Techsetters is simply "You can't be what you can't see". If we share the stories of women in executive positions
              in the tech sphere, we can show young women that they belong in STEM.</p>
              <h1 className='text-left font-bold mt-2'> My Favorite Part?</h1>
              <p>Hearing how the speakers and students from the audience appreciated the quality of questions. 
                I discovered a way to foster an authentic connection between the audience and the speaker. </p>
              <h1 className='text-left font-bold mt-2'> Some speakers included...</h1>
              <ul className='list-disc mt-2 ml-5'>
